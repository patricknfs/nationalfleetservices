		<p>Welcome to Tickets.</p>
	
		<p class="center"><img src="assets/images/tickets32.png" alt="Tickets" /></p>
		
		
		<p>Tickets is a full featured, yet easy to use help-desk system.</p>

		<p>It is great for users and businesses who wish to keep track of and manage support requests online.</p>

		<p>You can create multiple users, search tickets, convert POP3 emails into tickets, create custom priorities and much much more.</p>

		<p>Tickets has been designed to be easy to install and all config files and database files are created during the install. You simply need a web hosting account and one free MySQL database (no programming is required).</p>

		<p>You can easily upgrade to new versions free of charge. All your existing settings, users and tickets are kept intact.</p>

		<p>If you have any problems at all please leave a comment here and we will get back to you as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p>Tickets has been built around our own custom framework that is used in a number of different public and private applications. It has proven to be stable and secure.</p>

		<p>For advanced users or programmers you can create your own plugins to extend the program. Please see the Developers section for a link to the developer pack.</p>
				
		<p>Tickets is designed to be a stand alone web application, you are of course welcome to modify the code, but I cannot support modified code if it breaks.</p>
		
		<p>Whenever I release a new version of Tickets an upgrade script is included (more below), please make sure you keep Tickets up to date.</p>
		
		<p>Please note: If you modify the Tickets code the upgrade script may fail. It will be up to you to fix this if a problem occurs. You must support your own code changes.</p>

		<h3 id="requirements"><strong>System Requirements</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Tickets is written in PHP5.3 and uses a MySQL5 database. Tickets is a "Web Application" that must be installed on a Web Server.</p>

		<p>You must install Tickets on a web host that supports PHP5.3, MySQL5 and Apache.</p>
		
		<p>You may also install Tickets on your personal computer by using one of the many options (i.e google WAMPserver or XAMPP), this is not covered in this document.</p>
		
		<p>The full system requirements can be found below.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>PHP 5.3+</li>
			<li>MySQL 5+ with 1 empty database</li>
			<li>PHP PDO MySQL Extension</li>
			<li>PHP LDAP Exentsion (for Active Directory support)</li>
			<li>PHP GD Exentsion (for anti-spam capture)</li>
			<li>PHP able to write files to the installed directory</li>
			<li>Apache with Rewrite Module</li>
			<li>A Web Browser that supports HTML5/Javascript (IE9+, FireFox, Safari, Chrome)</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="install"><strong>Install</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>There are a number of steps required to install Tickets.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Copy the unzipped contents of the zip file to somewhere on your webserver. You can install Tickets in a folder on your existing web hosting or setup a new subdomain.</li>
			<li>Create an empty MySQL database (most hosting provides a control panel that allows you to do this).</li>
			<li>Ensure your PHP install can create files (for config.php to be created during the install).</li>
			<li>Run http://tickets.example.com/install/ from your web browser.</li>
			<li>Follow the steps.</li>
			<li>Backup your MySQL database and user/settings/config.php file.</li>
			<li>Setup a process to visit http://tickets.example.com/cron/ every 5 minutes (more info below in the CRON section).</li>
			<li>Done</li>
		</ol>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="permissions"><strong>Permissions for Install</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>During the Tickets install two files will be created, .htaccess (in the root of the tickets folder) and config.php (in user/settings/).</p>
		
		<p>These files are required for Tickets to function.</p>
		
		<p>If the install fails and is unable to write these files please check the security permissions on the tickets folder on your web server.</p>
		
		<p>On Linux/BSD/MacOS the easiest thing to do is to set the permissions of the entire folder to 777. Once the install has completed we recommend you switch back to 755.</p>

		<p>Otherwise you can simply try 755, it depends on your web host.</p>
		
		<p>For information on chmod permissions please see <a href="http://michaeldale.com.au/archive/2005/03/04/basics-of-chmod/">this page</a>.</p>
		
		<hr>
		
				
		<h3 id="upgrade"><strong>Upgrading</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Upgrading is pretty easy.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Download the latest version of the Tickets zip file</li>
			<li>Backup your MySQL database, config.php file and .htaccess file.</li>
			<li>Backup any custom code or changes you have made (this will be overwritten).</li>
			<li>Unzip the new install onto your local computer.</li>
			<li>Delete the install/ folder.</li>
			<li>Upload this to your existing install of Tickets replacing all existing files.</li>
			<li>Login</li>
			<li>Run the database upgrade from your web browser (run http://tickets.example.com/upgrade/).</li>
		</ol>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="cron"><strong>CRON Setup</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>The cron system allows Tickets to send and receive emails (and other tasks) in the background. Please ensure this is setup as it is a required task.</p>
		
		<p>There are a number of ways to set this up. The best method is to use a Linux Cron style setup on the server itself. This will be the most reliable method.</p>
		
		<p>Although you can use one of the many free web cron services, these often only work once every 10-15mintes, meaning that emails take longer to send.</p>
		
		<h4>Linux Cron</h4>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Type crontab -e in your linux command line.</li>
			<li>Type in the following: */5 * * * * wget -q -O /dev/null "http://tickets.example.com/cron/"</li>
			<li>Save</li>
			<li>crontab -l should now list the cron process</p>
		</ol>
		
		<p>If you do not have access to the command line you might have access to the web hosting control panel that should allow this. Otherwise talk with your webhost.</p>
		
		<h4>Windows Scheduled Task</h4>
		
		<p>Windows supports the same type of CRON process through the use of a Scheduled Task and a 3rd party wget program.</p>

		<p>If you have an existing contact form on your website you can simply create a new department in Tickets and POP3 account. Once this is done, setup your contact form to send emails to this new address. Tickets can then download these messages.</p>

		<h3 id="user_permissions"><strong>User Permissions</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Tickets includes 6 different user levels/permissions. These permissions allow you to add users with restricted access to features or tickets.</p>

		<h3 id="language"><strong>Custom Language</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>To create your own language</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Make sure you have a good text editor. On Windows I recommend <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org">Notepad++</a></li>
			<li>Ensure that you use the encoding type UTF-8 without BOM in the text editor.</li>
			<li>Copy system/languages/english_aus.lang.php to user/languages/example.php</li>
			<li>Open the new example.php file in your text editor.</li>
			<li>Change the words on the right hand side to match your language (leaving the left hand side alone).</li>
			<li>When finished save the file and close</li>
			<li>Load Tickets and go to Settings.</li>
			<li>Change the "Default Language" to "Example"</li>
		</ol>

		<p>When you make a new language, if you could please send it to me that would be great. I can then include this in future versions for everyone to use.</p>

		<h3 id="plugins"><strong>Plugins</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>As of version 1.4 tickets now supports plugins.</p>
		
		<p>Plugins allow you to extend Tickets without modifying the core code. This means that you can easily distribute extra functionality without requiring users to make any code changes.</p>
		
		<p>Plugins also allow users to upgrade to a new version of Tickets without needing to re-apply code changes.</p>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="hooks"><strong>Plugin Hooks</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>A plugin hook is an area where your plugin can interact with Tickets.</p>
		
		<p>During sections of processing Tickets will call a plugin hook, this is where your plugin comes alive.</p>
		
		<p>The plugin system allows you to add sections to Tickets that look exactly like the built in functionality.</p>
		
		<p>Below is an example of creating a hook.</p>
		
<pre>
//get the plugins class
$plugins 		= &amp;sts\singleton::get('sts\plugins');

//setup a hook
$plugins->add(
	array(
		'plugin_name'	=> 	__CLASS__,
		'task_name'		=> __CLASS__ . 'section_name',
		'section'		=> 'section_name',
		'method'		=> array($this, 'section_name')
	)
);	
</pre>

		<p>Plugins are stored in the user/plugins/ folder and can be activated from the settings page.</p>

      </li>
      <br>

      </li>
      <br>
      <li>If you have not opted to have the servicing/maintenance provided by  the leasing company then you are responsible for servicing the vehicle in  accordance with the manufacturer&rsquo;s schedule.   The vehicle must be returned to the leasing company in a roadworthy state.  Tyres must be at or above the legal limit.  If you need clarification of this please ask  for a copy of the BVRLA (British Vehicle Rental Leasing Association) guide  which can be provided upon request.  The  vehicle must have a valid MOT certificate if required.
